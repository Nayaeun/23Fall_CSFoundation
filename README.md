## Motivation and Background
Our team is excited to propose a Tamagotchi game as our computer science foundation project. Tamagotchi, the virtual pet simulation, gained immense popularity in the late '90s, and its charm still resonates with many. We believe recreating this classic in Python will not only provide us with a fun and engaging project but also allow us to delve deep into object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and basic Python methods and functions. By bringing back the nostalgia associated with Tamagotchi, we aim to captivate users with a modern twist.

## Project Description
Our Tamagotchi game will involve creating a virtual pet that users can adopt, care for, and watch grow. The pet will have various needs such as feeding, playing, and resting, and users will be responsible for meeting these needs to ensure their pet's well-being. The game will incorporate OOP principles, with different classes representing the pet and its various attributes. Users will interact with the game through a simple text-based interface, making it accessible to all levels of players.
